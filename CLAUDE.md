# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project

Primico — a local-first native Android and desktop todo app (Kotlin, Compose Multiplatform,
Material 3, SQLDelight). No analytics. Package `de.andi1984.cadence` throughout.

**The product is Primico; the code still says Cadence, on purpose.** The app was renamed on
2026-09-14 (an unrelated "Cadence: Aufgaben & Todo" reached the App Store first). Everything a
person sees says Primico: app names, window and tray, package names, release asset names and
their permanent URLs, the site, the docs. Everything that is a persisted identity or a published
contract keeps the old name: the Kotlin package `de.andi1984.cadence` and the Android
application id (a change means a fresh install for every user), the class names
(`CadenceViewModel`, `CadenceRepository`, …), the `CADENCE_*` environment variables and CI
secrets, the `cadence.backup` format string and `cadence.db` file name, the macOS bundle id and
the Windows upgrade UUID. The desktop data directory moved to `primico`/`Primico`, and
`PlatformDirs.dataDir()` adopts a `cadence`/`Cadence` directory in place on first start. Don't
"finish" the rename in code; the churn has no user-visible gain and the ADRs are history.

**Local-first, with an optional account.** The SQLite database on each device is the source of
truth and the app is fully usable signed out and offline; signing in (Settings) syncs your own
devices through a Neon project (Data API + Neon Auth, [ADR 0005](docs/adr/0005-neon-sync.md)),
hub-and-spoke, last-writer-wins — the protocol is still
[ADR 0002](docs/adr/0002-supabase-sync.md)'s. The synced-`backup.json` design ADR 0001 chose was
tried and removed — two devices writing one file is a conflict no program resolves.

Four modules: `:core` (Kotlin Multiplatform, the domain layer), `:ui` (Compose Multiplatform —
theme, components, formatters, every screen, the ViewModel), `:app-android` (the Android shell,
renamed from `:app` in ADR 0001 phase 4) and `:app-desktop` (the JVM shell for Ubuntu/macOS/
Windows, added in ADR 0001 phase 5). Both shells
are built out of `:core` and `:ui` in the steps laid out in
[`docs/adr/0001-desktop-app-and-multi-device-sync.md`](docs/adr/0001-desktop-app-and-multi-device-sync.md).

The product rule the whole app is built on: **importance first, due date breaks ties**
(`:ui`'s `ui/TaskSorting.kt`). Recurrence supports both calendar rules and "n days after completion".

A task lives in one **project** and wears any number of **tags** — cross-cutting labels, `@errand`
in quick add, with a flat list of their own ([ADR 0004](docs/adr/0004-tags.md)). Which tasks wear a
tag is a packed column on the *task*, not a join table; that one decision explains most of what the
tag code looks like.

The desktop is pointer- and keyboard-first, not a phone app in a window: drag and drop, right-click
menus, a command palette, a project-tree sidebar and a two-pane layout
([ADR 0003](docs/adr/0003-desktop-interaction-model.md)). Almost all of it is shared code in `:ui`
that Android leaves switched off.

## Commands

```bash
# What CI runs, in one invocation — configuring this build costs more than running it, so a
# second ./gradlew pays for all of it again. :app-android is not in the list: it has had no
# unit tests since storage moved to :core, and a bare `testDebugUnitTest` would still build its
# whole debug variant (31 tasks) to run none of them.
./gradlew :core:testDebugUnitTest :ui:testDebugUnitTest \
          :core:jvmTest :ui:jvmTest :app-desktop:test :ui:compileKotlinJvm
./gradlew assembleDebug            # app-android/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-android-debug.apk
./gradlew assembleRelease          # falls back to the debug key when no CADENCE_KEYSTORE is set

./gradlew :app-desktop:run                          # launch the desktop app from source
./gradlew :app-desktop:packageDistributionForCurrentOS   # deb+rpm+tarball / dmg / msi, per OS
./gradlew :app-desktop:packageUberJarForCurrentOS   # a runnable jar, no native packaging tools
                                                     # needed — what to reach for off Linux CI

# a single test class / method (method names are backticked sentences)
./gradlew :core:jvmTest --tests "de.andi1984.cadence.RecurrenceEngineTest"
./gradlew :core:jvmTest --tests "*RecurrenceEngineTest.monthly on a fixed day*"

# the whole release, staged into dist/ under the names the release links use
bash .github/scripts/build.sh              # apk + everything this OS can package
bash .github/scripts/build.sh deb --skip-tests   # one format, no tests
bash .github/scripts/build.sh --dry-run    # what it would run, and at which version
```

**`build.sh` is the build, and CI only calls it.** `android.yml`, `desktop.yml` and `release.yml`
each used to carry their own copy of "derive the version, run Gradle, copy the outputs", which is
how the three drifted apart; now each one runs the same script a laptop does, so a release can be
cut by hand — `gh release create` over `dist/` — without spending Actions minutes at all. It
derives the version the way CI does (`next-version.sh`, unless `CADENCE_VERSION_NAME` is already
set or `--version` overrides it), runs one Gradle invocation for every artefact rather than one
per target, stages the APKs under the fixed names the download URLs point at, and runs
`check-signing.sh`. A format whose packaging tool is missing — no `rpmbuild`, no WiX — is skipped
with a warning when `all`/`desktop` implied it and is a hard error when it was named outright.

`:core`'s and `:ui`'s tests are each one source set compiled twice: `jvmTest` is the desktop
compilation and `testDebugUnitTest` the Android one. `testDebugUnitTest` alone therefore misses
nothing in either module today, but it also never exercises the JVM target the desktop app is
built on, so CI names both. Storage lives entirely in `:core` now (ADR 0001, phase 2), so
`:app-android` has no unit tests of its own left — `RecurrenceCodecTest` and the SQLDelight store
tests moved with it.

`:ui`'s tests live in a `jvmSharedTest` source set mirroring `jvmShared`, and cover the part of
the module that is plain JVM Kotlin: the `CadenceUiState` derivations, `sortedFor`, and
`CadenceViewModel`'s undo state machine (a `StandardTestDispatcher` sharing `runTest`'s scheduler,
so the five-second undo window costs no wall clock). The ViewModel tests drive a real
`CadenceRepository` over the real SQLDelight stores on an in-memory SQLite database
(`jvmSharedTest`'s `TestDatabase.kt`, the same recipe as `:core`'s), with only the platform ports
faked (`Fakes.kt`). The ViewModel runs on `runTest`'s
`backgroundScope` rather than on the test coroutine — its `init` starts collectors that never
finish, and `runTest` waits for its own children — and the test subscribes to `state`, because
`stateIn(WhileSubscribed)` keeps the upstream cold until something reads it. The ViewModel test
sits in `jvmTest` rather than `jvmSharedTest`, alone among them — a placement supabase-kt used
to force (its client needed an Android runtime the unit-test JVM lacks) and the hand-rolled Ktor
stack no longer does; it simply has not moved. No screen is tested: composables
would need the Compose test runtime, and none of the rules worth pinning live in one.

`:app-desktop` is a plain JVM module, so its task is `:app-desktop:test`. It covers
`DesktopSettingsStore` (the file round-trip, what a truncated one falls back to, and that the
write leaves the caller's thread and still lands the newest value),
`DesktopWorkspaceStore` (the same, plus the clamps: a sidebar width outside its range, a window
position from a monitor that is gone), `DesktopReminderScheduler` (fires once per due task, and
forgets what the reconcile stops listing) and `DesktopNavigator` (the back/forward stacks, and
what happens to an open detail pane when the window is resized across the two-pane threshold) —
the classes there with no Compose in them.

`assembleDebug` only ever compiles `:ui`'s *Android* target, and its tests reach only the
plain-Kotlin half. CI therefore also runs `:ui:compileKotlinJvm` on its own: without it the
Android build could stay green while the screens the desktop app is mostly made of stopped
compiling for the JVM.

**A test that hands a class its own `CoroutineScope` must use `runTest`'s `backgroundScope`.**
This is the one rule here that has actually cost real time. `runTest` drains the shared
`TestScheduler` once the test body returns, and a `while (true) { … delay(n) }` loop running on
that scheduler — `DesktopReminderScheduler`'s poll, and anything like it — always has one more
`delay` queued, so the drain never reaches idle. Nothing fails: the test JVM spins at 100% CPU
forever, which on a runner means the job burns its time limit and reports nothing. A scope of
our own plus an `@After { scope.cancel() }` does not help, because `@After` runs *after* the
drain. `backgroundScope` already runs on the test's scheduler and is cancelled *before* it, so
it is both the shorter code and the only correct one. `CadenceViewModelUndoTest`,
`CadenceViewModelCrudTest` and `DesktopReminderSchedulerTest` all take their scope from it.

**No mocking library, and no second test framework.** JUnit 4 + `org.junit.Assert` +
`kotlin.test` + `kotlinx-coroutines-test`, with hand-written fakes for the *platform* ports —
`ReminderScheduler`, `BackupGateway`, `AttachmentOpener`, `SettingsStore`, the sync session — in
`:ui`'s `Fakes.kt`. **The store ports are never faked**: every test that touches storage, the
repository's and the ViewModel's included, runs the real `SqlDelight*Store`s over an in-memory
SQLite database (`TestDatabase.kt` in each module's `jvmSharedTest`, `Dispatchers.Unconfined`
throughout so nothing leaves `runTest`'s scheduler). The store contract — tombstones hidden from
every read, `completeIfOpen`'s idempotence, the `sortOrder != position` guard, a section delete
freeing its tasks — used to be implemented three times, once in SQL and twice in fakes, and only
the SQL was pinned; a `:ui` test was found asserting the fake's behaviour where it contradicted
the store's. The store ports therefore remain a seam with exactly one adapter, kept for their
vocabulary (`Task` and `Project`, not rows), not so that a test can plug something else in. The
fakes that remain back a *real* `CadenceRepository` for the same reason: the rules under test are
the repository's, and faking it would assert only that the ViewModel called what the test told it
to expect. The one place a test stands between the repository and SQLite is
`CadenceViewModelUndoTest`'s `GatedStoreTransaction`, a delegating `StoreTransaction` wrapper with
a hook before `run`, which is how the #114 "undo leaves a settled delete hidden" state is reached
— it used to hook `TaskStore.tombstoneWithSubtasks` directly, before `deleteTask`'s write moved
into one `storeTransaction.run { … }` call with nothing left inside it going through the ordinary
store ports (see the `StoreTransaction` note above).

JDK 17, compileSdk/targetSdk 35, minSdk 26. No lint or format task is wired up.

The server half of sync is `neon/migrations/*.sql` ([ADR 0005](docs/adr/0005-neon-sync.md)): four
tables, forced RLS over `auth.user_id()`, the stale-write trigger, `migrate.sh`, `db.sh` and a
docker test. `neon/CLAUDE.md` holds the rules for it, the Data API default-privileges gotcha
included, and loads when working under `neon/`.

**The sync endpoints are compiled in at build time, and there is no default.** `:core`'s
`generateNeonConfig` Gradle task reads `CADENCE_NEON_DATA_API_URL` and `CADENCE_NEON_AUTH_URL`
from the environment of the Gradle invocation and writes them into a generated
`NeonBuildConfig`; `NeonConfig.fromBuild` is that pair, or `null` when either was unset. The
URLs used to be committed defaults naming the maintainer's project, which was fine while the
repository was private and wrong once it was not: every build from source would have pointed at
one person's database. They also used to be read from the environment at *run* time, which
never worked on Android — a phone has no shell environment. A `null` config makes
`CadenceSyncEngine` inert: `status` is `SyncStatus.Unconfigured` for the life of the process,
Settings shows a paragraph instead of the sign-in form, `SyncStatus.hasAccount` (the extension
every other surface reads) is false, `signIn` refuses, and every round returns before making a
request — a session the store still holds from a configured build is ignored, not replayed
against nothing (`CadenceSyncEngineTest`'s unconfigured case pins all of it). The official
builds get the two values from repository secrets, set alongside the signing secrets by
`tools/release-signing-wizard.sh`; a fork builds against its own project by exporting the two
variables — `docs/self-hosting.md` is the walkthrough. The URLs grant nothing on their own:
there is no API key in this design; the credential is the account, and RLS is what protects
the rows. The account itself is created in the Neon console's Auth tab — the app has sign-in
only, no sign-up.

```bash
./gradlew connectedDebugAndroidTest   # needs a device; CI has no emulator
```

The only instrumented test is `QuickAddPatternsDeviceTest`: it compiles the quick-add grammar
with the device's ICU regex engine, which the JVM tests cannot do (see Localisation below).
Run it after touching `QuickAddPatterns` or a lexicon.

## Architecture

**One ViewModel for the entire app.** `CadenceViewModel` combines `repository.tasks`,
`repository.projects` and `settingsStore.state` into a single `CadenceUiState`, exposed as a
`StateFlow`. Every screen is a stateless composable that receives that whole `state` plus
callbacks — no per-screen ViewModel, no per-screen data loading. Derived views (overdue, inbox,
tasks-in-project, project labels) are computed by helper methods **on `CadenceUiState`**, so add
new derivations there rather than filtering inside a screen.

It is a **plain class**, not an `androidx.lifecycle.ViewModel`: there is no ViewModel on the
desktop, and the only two things the Android shell actually needs from the lifecycle library are
a scope that survives a rotation and a moment to stop. Both are constructor parameters
(`scope`) and a method (`close()`), and `:app-android`'s `CadenceViewModelHost` — an
`androidx.lifecycle.ViewModel` whose whole body is one field — supplies them from
`viewModelScope`. `:app-desktop`'s `main()` supplies them instead: a plain `CoroutineScope` it
creates and keeps alive for the process, and `Window`'s `onCloseRequest`.

**Wiring** is hand-rolled in an `AppContainer` class per shell, built on top of `:core`'s
`CadenceCore` — the database, the blob store, the eight-argument `CadenceRepository` and the
`CadenceSyncEngine` over them, and the application scope all three run on. Every store a feature
adds used to mean a line in both `AppContainer`s; it is now a line in `CadenceCore` alone, since
opening the database is the one genuinely platform-specific step left (`DatabaseDriverFactory`
takes a `Context` on Android and a `File` on the desktop) and each shell still does that itself
before handing the driver to `CadenceCore`. `:app-android`'s `AppContainer` is built once in
`CadenceApplication.onCreate` and reached through
`ViewModelProvider.AndroidViewModelFactory.APPLICATION_KEY`; `:app-desktop`'s is a plain
`AppContainer()` constructed once at the top of `main()` — no Activity, no Application, so no
factory to hang it from. No DI framework either way — a singleton shared by both shells goes in
`CadenceCore`, one that is genuinely platform-specific (SharedPreferences, AlarmManager, SAF, a
JSON settings file, a tray icon) goes in the shell's `AppContainer`. `:ui`'s
`cadenceViewModel(core, adapters, scope)` (`CadenceViewModelFactory.kt`) builds the ViewModel
over a `CadenceCore` plus a `ViewModelAdapters` of the four platform ports, so the
seven-argument `CadenceViewModel` constructor is written once rather than once per shell.

**Navigation** lives entirely in each shell — the part of the UI that does *not* move.
`:app-android`'s `ui/CadenceApp.kt` uses `androidx.navigation.compose`: route constants in
`Routes`, one `NavHost`, bottom bar + FAB shown only on the four top-level destinations.
`:app-desktop`'s `ui/Navigation.kt` does not depend on that Android-only artifact: a
`DesktopNavigator` holds a back stack, a **forward** stack (`Alt`+`←`/`→`, which `NavHost` never
gave us) and the detail pane's occupant. Both shells call the same screen composables with the
same callbacks; only the chrome around them and how a route is stored differ. Quick-add is a sheet
driven by composable state on both, not a route.

The desktop chrome is a **sidebar** (`ui/Sidebar.kt`) rather than a rail: the views plus the whole
project tree and the tag list, resizable, foldable, and a drop target on every row — a task
dropped on a tag row is labelled with it. At 1000dp and up the window
draws **two panes** and a detail route fills the second one instead of pushing; below that it
pushes as before, and resizing across the threshold moves an open detail between the two rather
than dropping it (ADR 0003, decision 7). Everything ADR 0001 §8 left for later — the detail pane,
the command palette (`Ctrl`/`Cmd`+`K`) — landed with ADR 0003; only the desktop *language* setting
of ADR 0001 decision 9 is still outstanding.

**`:ui` states its platform needs as ports too.** `:core` already treats storage that way; the
same idea covers everything else the app touches that Android and the desktop do differently.
`ui/platform/Ports.kt` declares `ReminderScheduler`, `BackupGateway`, `BackupFilePicker`,
`AttachmentFilePicker` and `AttachmentOpener`, plus
`BackupTarget` — an opaque string that is a SAF content uri on Android and a plain absolute path
on the desktop, which `:ui` only ever hands back. `:app-android` implements all three
(`AlarmReminderScheduler`, `BackupIo`, `rememberSafBackupFilePicker`) and `:app-desktop`
implements the same three (`DesktopReminderScheduler`, `DesktopBackupIo`,
`DesktopBackupFilePicker`), and no screen learns which shell it got. **Sync is deliberately not a
port**: HTTPS and JSON are identical on both platforms, so `CadenceSyncEngine` is a concrete class
in `:core` that `CadenceCore` constructs once, on the application scope both shells share
(ADR 0002, decision 7). `SettingsStore` is a port
for the same reason, declared next to the settings types in `ui/settings/SettingsStore.kt` —
`SharedPrefsSettingsStore` on Android, `DesktopSettingsStore` (a JSON file under `PlatformDirs`)
on the desktop. The desktop's *window* state — sidebar width, folded projects, window bounds — is
deliberately **not** in `CadenceSettings` and lives in a second file, `workspace.json`
(`DesktopWorkspaceStore`): none of it means anything on a phone, and putting it in the shared
object would give `SharedPrefsSettingsStore` fields it can never set (ADR 0003, decision 8).

**Two composition locals carry desktop-only row behaviour, and Android leaves them at their
defaults** (ADR 0003, decision 3). `RowInteractions` is the right-click menu's callbacks plus the
drag gesture; `RowSelectionState` is which row the keyboard is on. `:app-desktop` provides both
around its content and `TaskRow` reads them, which is how seven screens gained both without a
single signature changing. `assembleDebug` compiling is therefore *not* proof Android is
unaffected by a change to either — the defaults are what it runs.

**Storage is a port, not a layer, and it lives in `:core` entirely (ADR 0001, phase 2).**
`CadenceRepository` reaches storage through three interfaces in `data/Stores.kt` that speak `Task`
and `Project` rather than rows and carry no database annotation. `data/db/SqlDelightStores.kt`
implements them over the SQLDelight schema in `data/db/*.sq`, and every row↔domain conversion
lives there — epoch day/second-of-day/epoch-millis at the boundary, nowhere else. This is
possible because SQLDelight itself is multiplatform, unlike Room: `:app-android` supplies the
`DatabaseDriverFactory` actual (`AndroidSqliteDriver`, needing a `Context`) and `:app-desktop`
the `jvmMain` one (`JdbcSqliteDriver`, needing `PlatformDirs.dataDir()`) — both open the same
schema; see "Persistence" below.

`TaskStore.completeIfOpen` and `reopenIfDone` return whether *this* call changed the row, and an
implementation must decide that inside the store — in SQL, in a lock, in whatever it has — never
against the `Task` it was handed. That is the whole idempotency guarantee; see the completion
notes below.

**`StoreTransaction` is the one seam for making several of those stores commit together**
(`data/Stores.kt`). `CadenceRepository.setCompleted`, `deleteTask` and `deleteProject` are each a
short chain of otherwise-independent store calls that only make sense as a unit — see the
completion notes below for what a process kill mid-chain used to leave behind — and
`storeTransaction.run { … }` is how the repository says "these calls are one write." The block
runs against a `TransactionScope`, not the ordinary suspend `TaskStore`/`ProjectStore`/
`AttachmentStore`, and deliberately: `SqlDelightStoreTransaction.run` opens one SQLDelight
transaction, whose own callback SQLDelight declares as a plain, non-suspend `() -> T` — an
earlier version tried handing `block` the suspend ports directly and bridged the gap with a
coroutine intrinsic, and a real test (`CadenceViewModelUndoTest`'s in-flight-delete case) caught
what that costs: a store call that genuinely suspends does not "come back later" inside a
transaction callback that has already returned, so its writes land nowhere near the transaction
that gave up on it. `TransactionScope`'s members are plain functions talking straight to
`TaskQueries`/`ProjectQueries`/`AttachmentQueries` — the same shape `mergeRecords` already used
for a merge — which rules that out structurally: nothing reachable from inside `run` can suspend.
The recurrence and subtask *rules* stay exactly where they were, in the repository; only how the
writes they decide on land is different.

`:core` is a Kotlin Multiplatform module with an **android** and a **jvm** target, and all
hand-written code lives in a hand-declared `jvmShared` source set that both targets depend on —
not in `commonMain`. Both targets are the JVM, so `jvmShared` may use the JDK, which is why
`RecurrenceEngine` still speaks `java.time` rather than `kotlinx-datetime`. `commonMain` carries
no hand-written code on purpose; it starts earning its keep the day a browser target exists (ADR
0001, phase 7), and moving code there before that would buy a portability nothing needs at the
price of rewriting every date in the app. The one exception is *generated*: SQLDelight compiles
`data/db/*.sq` into query code under `commonMain` by default, which is fine — that generated code
touches no JDK API, only `app.cash.sqldelight`'s own multiplatform runtime. `DatabaseDriverFactory`
(`data/db/DatabaseDriverFactory.kt`) is the actual JDK/Android boundary, and it is `jvmShared`'s
first `expect`/`actual` pair: `expect class DatabaseDriverFactory` declares no constructor, so the
`androidMain` actual can take a `Context` and the `jvmMain` one a data directory `File` without
either matching the other's shape — still Beta as of Kotlin 2.0, hence
`-Xexpect-actual-classes` in `core/build.gradle.kts`.

Consequence worth knowing: **smart casts do not cross a module boundary.** `if (task.dueDate !=
null) task.dueDate.isAfter(…)` compiled while everything was one module and does not now. Bind a
local (`val due = task.dueDate`) or use `?.` — `task.dueDate?.isAfter(today) == true` — rather
than reaching for `!!`.

### Persistence gotchas

- **`sortOrder` is a value the app writes now** (ADR 0003, decision 1). It was in every table from
  the first schema and nothing ever set it, so "manual" order was id order.
  `CadenceRepository.reorderTasks`/`reorderProjects`/`reorderSections` renumber a list **densely
  from 0**, and a new row lands at `max + 1` in its bucket rather than sharing 0 with everything
  else. Dense integers rather than gaps or midpoints: sync merges rows, not lists, so two devices
  reordering concurrently interleave under last-writer-wins whatever the numbering. The
  `sortOrder != :sortOrder` guard in `updateSortOrder` is load-bearing — it keeps a drag from
  restamping `updatedAt` on the rows that did not move, and so from pushing a whole list.
- Every id — task, project — is a **UUIDv7 string**, minted by `CadenceRepository` (not by
  storage) via `domain/id/UuidV7.kt` the moment a new row is created; `Task.id`/`Project.id`
  default to `""`, and `upsertTask`/`upsertProject` mint a real id exactly when that default is
  still blank. A recurring task's successor id is *derived*, not minted —
  `UuidV7.successorId(spawnedFromId, occurrenceDate)` — so two devices completing the same
  occurrence offline produce the same id once the phase-6 merge engine exists (ADR 0001,
  decision 4). `TaskStore.insert`/`ProjectStore.insert` therefore take a row that already carries
  its final id and return nothing.
- `taskRow`/`projectRow` are the schema's table names, not `task`/`project` — SQLDelight names the
  generated row class after the table, and `Task`/`Project` were already taken by the domain
  model. The tables live in `data/db/Task.sq`, `data/db/Project.sq`, `data/db/Section.sq`,
  `data/db/Tag.sq`, `data/db/Attachment.sq` and
  `data/db/SyncState.sq`. **The schema is at version 5 and has a migration chain**: shipped
  installs of older versions exist, so a schema change means both editing the `.sq` file *and*
  adding an `N.sqm` beside it (`1.sqm` migrates 1→2 and adds `syncStateRow`; `2.sqm` migrates
  2→3, rebuilding both tables to drop foreign keys; `3.sqm` adds sections; `4.sqm` adds tags), the
  way `MIGRATION_3_4`
  used to work under Room. **A column added from now on goes last in its `.sq` file**: `ALTER
  TABLE … ADD COLUMN` can only append, every read is a `SELECT *`, and the generated mapper takes
  its arguments positionally — so a fresh database that declared `taskRow.tagIds` anywhere but at
  the end would hand that mapper a different column than a migrated one does. Once it is in the
  schema, a column is converted in exactly two places in `SqlDelightStores.kt`: `Task.toRow()`
  (domain → columns, the one row every UPDATE forwards and `insertIfAbsent` binds whole via
  `VALUES ?`) and `toTask` (columns → domain) — the same pair per entity for `Project`, `Section`
  and `Tag`. No conversion belongs in a query wrapper's argument list. `AndroidSqliteDriver` runs migrations from its callback; the desktop's
  `JdbcSqliteDriver` has no such lifecycle, so `DatabaseDriverFactory` tracks the version in
  SQLite's own `PRAGMA user_version` — where **0 means "version 1, from before we counted"**,
  because nothing set it until now and the file already has the version-1 tables.
- **No write deletes the row it is about to insert, and `taskRow`/`projectRow` carry no foreign
  key.** Both are the same lesson. SQLite implements `INSERT OR REPLACE` as *delete the
  conflicting row, then insert*, both shells open the database with `PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON`,
  and the two tables used to cascade on `parentId` and set null on `projectId` — so saving an edit
  to a task deleted its checklist and its attachments, and merging one project row deleted its
  subprojects and emptied it of tasks. Writes are upserts now (`updateRow` + `insertIfAbsent`,
  because SQLite before 3.24 has no `ON CONFLICT … DO UPDATE` and minSdk 26 ships 3.19), and the
  merge is the same pair with last-writer-wins moved into the UPDATE's `WHERE` (`updateIfOlder`),
  which is also what removed a `SELECT` per merged row. The constraints went with them: a
  local-first app cannot enforce referential integrity when rows arrive in whatever order the
  pull pages them — a task landing before its project failed the whole merge with
  `SQLITE_CONSTRAINT_FOREIGNKEY` — which is why the Postgres mirror has never had one either.
  `attachmentRow → taskRow` keeps its cascade: attachments are local, never merged, and nothing
  references them back. Foreign keys are therefore switched on *after* migrating, not before —
  `DROP TABLE taskRow` inside `2.sqm` would otherwise take every attachment with it.
- Every row carries `updatedAt` (epoch millis) and `deletedAt` (epoch millis, nullable). **Deleting
  is a tombstone, not a `DELETE`** (`docs/adr/0002-supabase-sync.md`): the row stays, `deletedAt` is
  stamped, and every read in `Task.sq`/`Project.sq` filters `deletedAt IS NULL`. A delete has to
  travel — another device that merely fails to find a row cannot tell "deleted" from "never heard
  of it", and puts it back. Two consequences when adding a query: filter tombstones unless you are
  sync, and use `selectByIdIncludingDeleted` when you need to compare against one. `updatedAt` is
  stamped by `CadenceRepository.now()`, truncated to milliseconds so a row cannot ping-pong against
  Postgres's microsecond timestamps. `now()` and the private `today()` both read a `Clock`
  constructor parameter (`Clock.systemDefaultZone()` by default) rather than calling
  `Instant.now()`/`LocalDate.now()` directly, which is also where `setCompleted`'s recurrence
  step, `shiftDueDate`'s snooze base and `rescheduleOverdueToToday`'s target default from — so a
  test can pin a fixed clock and assert an actual timestamp instead of only comparing one stamp to
  another.
- `taskRow` stores dates as **epoch day** (`Long`) and times as **second of day** (`Long`);
  conversion to `LocalDate`/`LocalTime` happens in the private mappers in
  `data/db/SqlDelightStores.kt`. Nothing outside that file should touch the raw numbers.
- Recurrence rules are serialised into a **single TEXT column** as `v1;key=value;…` by
  `RecurrenceCodec` (now in `:core`, since storage is). Adding a rule field means extending the
  codec (and its `VERSION` handling), not adding a column. Malformed input decodes to `null`,
  never throws.
- `TaskQueries.completeIfOpen`/`reopenIfDone` report nothing directly — SQLDelight has no
  Room-style "return the row count" on an `UPDATE`. The store runs the update and
  `TaskQueries.changes()` (SQLite's `SELECT changes()`) inside one `database.transactionWithResult
  { }`, so the two run on the same connection and `changes()` reads back *this* statement's count.
- **An `IN :list` query is bounded, and the bound is 999.** SQLDelight expands `IN :taskIds` into
  one bind parameter per element, and `SQLITE_MAX_VARIABLE_NUMBER` is 999 on the SQLite that
  Android API 26-29 ship — inside the minSdk 26 range. The danger zone hands over *every* task
  id and a big project hands over its whole list, so `SqlDelightAttachmentStore` chunks at
  `SQL_VARIABLE_LIMIT` (900) rather than trusting the driver. The desktop's xerial driver allows
  32766 and a recent phone allows the same, so nothing in the test suite reproduces the crash —
  a new query taking a list has to chunk on the way in, and dedupe across chunks on the way out,
  since `DISTINCT` only ever sees one chunk.

### Behaviour worth knowing before editing

- **Completing a recurring task** (`CadenceRepository.setCompleted`) keeps the finished row in
  place — so it stays visible in Today — and *inserts a new row* for the next occurrence.
  Recurrence is modelled as a chain of rows, not one row with a moving date, linked by
  `spawnedFromId` — "this row replaces that finished occurrence". Everything below follows from
  the chain being rows rather than a moving date, so a new list or a new completion path has to
  answer the same three questions:
  - **Completing must be idempotent.** Every caller passes a `Task` the UI drew a row from, and a
    checkbox tapped twice hands back the same *open* snapshot both times.
    `TaskStore.completeIfOpen` closes the row in SQL and reports whether this call is the one that
    closed it, so only that call schedules the successor and the rest of the work reads the row
    back instead of trusting the snapshot. Don't replace it with a plain `update`.
  - **Closing the row and inserting its successor are one write.** Both, and the subtask shift and
    the attachment cloning beside them, run inside one `storeTransaction.run { … }` (see the note
    on `StoreTransaction` above) — they used to be several separate writes, and a process killed
    between "closed" and "successor inserted" left a completed row with no successor, silently
    ending the recurrence. Reopening gets the same treatment, for the mirror reason: a kill between
    "reopened" and "successor removed" left the task standing in the list twice.
  - **An overdue occurrence hands over to the first one that is not behind us, and there is
    no flag that says otherwise any more.** `RecurrenceEngine.dueDateAfterCompletion` steps a
    task done on its day, or early, from its own due date; one completed *late* walks the rule
    forward past every occurrence before the completion day, so a daily task ticked off a month
    late is due today (today's instance is still open) and a Monday task done the following
    Wednesday is due next Monday. It used to stop strictly after the completion day, which sent
    that Monday task done on a Monday to the week after. `RecurrenceRule.keepMissed` — "skipped
    ones stay overdue", i.e. one step on however far behind — has been removed outright rather
    than defaulted off a third time: it was written as an explicit `true` into every rule created
    before mid-August 2026 and by every Todoist import, so flipping defaults never reached the
    rules that actually existed. The three decoders (`RecurrenceCodec`, `BackupCodec`,
    `RemoteRecords`) ignore the segment/key/column a stored rule still carries. The two
    published shapes — file and wire — spell a rule as enum *names*, and both DTOs decode
    through one `RecurrenceRule.fromNames` (unknown name → the field's default, unknown weekday
    dropped); the packed `RecurrenceCodec` column keeps its own decoder, since a missing `mode`
    there means "no rule", not "the default one".
  - **Reopening undoes both halves**: the row opens again and the occurrence that completion
    inserted is deleted (`TaskStore.openSuccessorsOf`), or the task would stand in the list twice.
    One that has itself been ticked off is left alone — the chain has moved on. `setCompleted`
    returns the ids it deleted so the ViewModel can cancel their alarms.
  - **Undated lists show a chain as one task.** `CadenceUiState.rootTasks` drops a completed
    occurrence that has been replaced (`withoutSupersededOccurrences`), because the Inbox and a
    project are not scoped to a day and a daily task would otherwise leave a struck-through copy
    in them every day. Today and Upcoming filter by date and Search is meant to reach history, so
    all three read `state.tasks` directly.
- **Subtasks are tasks with a `parentId`**, nested exactly one level deep — `addSubtask` files a
  step added under a subtask next to it rather than starting a third level. A parent and its
  steps share a project (`moveToProject` moves both), deleting a task deletes its steps
  (`deleteWithSubtasks`), and finishing a parent finishes whatever is still open beneath it. A
  recurring parent hands its checklist to the next occurrence unticked, with the subtask due
  dates shifted by the same span as the parent's. Which lists show them is a deliberate split:
  the container views (Inbox, projects) use `CadenceUiState.rootTasks()` because the parent
  already speaks for its steps there, while the date-driven views (Today, Upcoming, Search) show
  a dated subtask in its own right, labelled with the parent's title.
- **Reminders reconcile on every task emission**: the ViewModel collects `repository.tasks` and
  `settingsStore.state` together and calls `ReminderScheduler.sync(tasks, leadMinutes, enabled)`,
  which schedules *or cancels* a reminder for every task. **The diff — what to arm, what to
  cancel, what to leave alone — and the grace rule below live in one place,
  `domain/reminder/ReminderReconciler.kt` (`:core`, pure, tested on the JVM)**: each shell's
  scheduler loads what it has armed, applies the `Arm`/`Cancel`/`Keep` commands and persists the
  result, and neither derives "still wanted" for itself any more — Android's grace is ten
  minutes, the desktop's is zero. Android's alarms are **exact and
  Doze-proof** (`setExactAndAllowWhileIdle`, under `USE_EXACT_ALARM` — granted at install on
  13+, no prompt — plus `SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM` for 12/12L), degrading to `setAndAllowWhileIdle`
  when `canScheduleExactAlarms()` says the user revoked it. They used to be inexact
  (`setWindow`, ten minutes) so that no permission was needed, and that cost the lead-minutes
  feature its first release: a "5 minutes before" alarm with a ten-minute window can land after
  the task is due, an inexact alarm is deferred outright while the phone dozes — the one state
  a reminder exists to interrupt — and once the trigger was in the past the next `sync` cancelled
  the still-undelivered alarm. Two rules follow: **an armed alarm nothing plans any more whose
  trigger passed less than the grace ago is left alone, neither re-armed nor cancelled**
  (re-arming a past trigger fires it again at once, cancelling it is the race above — and an
  `Arm` naming a past instant, which AlarmManager cannot honour, is dropped and settled by the
  same rule through `ReminderReconciler.retire`), and a (task, lead) pair the reconciler
  cancels goes through `cancelLead`, which looks up an existing request code rather than
  minting one — so a task with no time never grows the code store. `ReminderRequestCodes` keeps
  the armed set with its instants, one packed string per task, and is the only Android code
  that knows the store's shape. The desktop has
  no AlarmManager at all, so `DesktopReminderScheduler` instead polls the synced task list every
  30 seconds and fires a system-tray balloon for whatever just came due — which only works
  while the app is running, same accepted trade-off ADR 0001 §8 names for a killed Android
  process.
- **A task can carry several reminders, not one.** `CadenceSettings.reminderLeadMinutes` is a
  per-device list of "notify me this many minutes before" values (Settings → Notify me before, a
  chip per preset plus a custom one the user can add) — empty by default, since a fresh install,
  or an existing task that already has a due time, must not suddenly start notifying for
  something nobody configured. `domain/reminder/ReminderPlanner.kt` (`:core`, pure, unit-tested on
  the JVM) is the one answer both shells' schedulers ask "when": for a task with `dueTime` set —
  quick-add's "18 Uhr" already fills it in — it returns one instant per configured lead, counted
  back from that time; for a task with `reminderTime` set (the older, manually-picked, exact-time
  reminder, independent of `dueTime`) it returns one more instant, reported with lead `0`. It
  deliberately does **not** filter by "now": AlarmManager cannot fire retroactively, so Android
  discards a past instant and cancels whatever alarm was there; the desktop has no such limit and
  fires on the very next poll after a reminder that elapsed while the app was closed, exactly as
  it always did. Each platform scheduler therefore needs one alarm identity per **(task id, lead
  minutes)** pair rather than per task — Android's `ReminderRequestCodes` keys a `PendingIntent` on
  the pair (lead `0` keeps the bare task id it always used, so upgrading changes nothing about an
  alarm that predates lead times) and separately persists which leads are currently armed for a
  task, so a lead value removed from Settings gets its outstanding alarm cancelled on the next
  sync rather than firing once more; the desktop's `DesktopReminderScheduler` keys its three maps
  the same way with a `ReminderKey(taskId, leadMinutes)`.
- **A bare time in quick-add defaults the due date to today.** "Kochen 18 Uhr" has no date word of
  its own, so `QuickAddParser.parse`'s `resolvedDue` falls back to `today` whenever `dueTime`
  parsed to something and neither an explicit date nor a recurrence rule claimed one — the same
  way "Kochen morgen 19 Uhr" is already tomorrow because "morgen" claims the date itself. A
  recurrence still wins over the bare-time fallback: "every monday at 9am" is a schedule, not
  "today at 9am, once."
- **Home-screen widgets are Glance, live in `:app-android/widget/`, and are Android-only.** The
  rules for them — snapshot plus flow, `ListView` items, distinct intent URIs, write aftercare,
  midnight refresh — are in `app-android/CLAUDE.md`, loaded when working under that module.
- **A tag is identity only; membership is a column on the task** (ADR 0004). `tagRow` carries a
  name, a colour and a position. Which tasks wear it is `taskRow.tagIds`, packed comma-separated by
  `TagIdsCodec` — **there is no join table, deliberately**, and the reasons are worth knowing before
  changing any of it:
  - **Deleting a tag writes one row.** No task is rewritten, so the ids stay behind on every task
    that named it, and `CadenceUiState.tagsOf` is what drops an id no live tag answers to — the
    same "links are repaired rather than trusted" rule `BackupCodec` follows. It also means
    reviving a tag, from a backup or from the other device, puts it back on exactly the tasks that
    had it. A join table would have made one delete into one row per labelled task on the wire.
  - **A pull can deliver a task before the tag it names**, so `setTaskTags` keeps an unknown id
    rather than pruning it. Pruning on write would erase a label a moment before its tag landed.
  - **The cost is stated in the ADR and is real**: two devices adding *different* tags to the same
    task offline resolve last-writer-wins over the whole set, and one addition is lost. The same
    trade the app already makes for a concurrently edited title.
  - **The wire and the backup file are not packed.** `tasks.tag_ids` is a Postgres `uuid[]` (GIN
    indexed) and `BackupTask.tagIds` is a JSON array; the packed string is a storage detail.
  - **Names are unique case-insensitively, as a validation only.** `@home` has to mean one tag on
    this device; sync can still land two, and both are then shown. Reconciling them would rewrite
    the tasks naming the loser, which is the O(n) write the whole design avoids.
  - **Quick add takes `@handle`, and an unmatched handle creates the tag** — unlike `#project`,
    which only ever selects. Tags are also the one token kind that repeats, and the `@` must start
    a word (checked in Kotlin, not with a `\b`; see Localisation). Because an unmatched handle
    *creates*, `matchingHandle`'s prefix pass answers only when **exactly one** tag matches
    (`singleOrNull`): with `@workout` and `@workshop` both present, a generous `@work` would label
    the task wrongly and leave a tag actually called *work* unreachable from that line forever.
  - **A label on a parent does not reach its steps**, unlike a project or a section. A recurring
    task *does* hand its labels to the next occurrence, with the checklist and the attachments.
  - **Where they are reached from**: the Projects screen on both shells, plus the desktop sidebar
    and `Ctrl`/`Cmd`+`K` under an `@` prefix. Deliberately not a fifth bottom-bar destination —
    tags find work, they are not a place it lives.
  - **Search reads labels, and a leading `@` narrows to them** (`TaskLists.kt`'s `searchList`).
    That is how a phone reaches a tag by typing at all — the palette that answers `@` is the
    desktop's. Without the prefix, title, notes and labels are all matched, since "errand" and
    "@errand" are the same thought.
  - **A tag is dropped *onto*, never *into*.** `DropTarget.IntoTag` applies a label and keeps the
    ones the task has — add-only, so `CadenceViewModel.applyTag` exists beside `toggleTag`: the
    dragged row is a snapshot, and a toggle would take a label back off a task that gained it
    meanwhile. Dragging a *tag* only ever reorders (`OrderedList.Tags`), because a tag holds
    nothing and dropping one on another could only mean "merge", which is the O(n) rewrite the
    packed column exists to avoid. The Tags screen is the only place `sortOrder` can be written,
    and it writes it two ways: dragging, on the desktop only — `DragAndDropHost` wraps that
    window and nothing on Android, where a drag source would swallow the list's scroll and then
    do nothing — and **Move up / Move down** in the row menu, on both.
- **An attachment is a local fact: the row is the truth, the blob is a cache**
  (`docs/attachments-and-share.md`, phase 2). A LINK is a URL; a FILE points at bytes
  content-addressed by SHA-256 under `filesDir/attachments/`. Neither is in the wire shape and
  neither is in the backup file yet (the bundle is phase 4), so **no attachment write arms the
  sync debounce** — there is nothing for a round to push. What that costs and what it buys:
  - **A missing blob is a state to draw, never an error.** A backup restored without its files, a
    second device, a process killed mid-copy: the row stays and the bytes are gone. The card
    greys it, says "not on this device", and offers **Find file** —
    `CadenceRepository.relocateAttachment` heals the row *in place* rather than adding a second
    one, and accepts bytes that hash differently (a re-exported invoice is a different file with
    the same meaning; refusing it would leave the row broken forever).
  - **Presence is read once per emission, never per row per frame.**
    `CadenceRepository.attachmentIndex` pairs the rows with the hashes on disk in one flow —
    stating each distinct hash once, on the I/O dispatcher — and `CadenceUiState.isPresent`
    answers from that set. A screen that touched the filesystem while drawing would stat the same
    directory a hundred times a second. The pair travels as one value so it can never be drawn
    half-updated.
  - **Blob I/O is dispatched by the repository, because `BlobStore` is plain `java.io`.** Every
    other port dispatches its own; this one is handed `ioDispatcher` instead, since a 25 MB copy
    on Android's ViewModel scope is the main thread. Tests pass `Dispatchers.Unconfined` for the
    same reason the SQLDelight stores take one — a real dispatcher inside `attachmentIndex`'s
    `flowOn` puts the state flow on a thread `runTest`'s virtual clock does not control.
  - **Thumbnails are hand-rolled and bounded, not Coil.** `ByteArray.decodeToImageBitmap()` is
    multiplatform and already on the classpath (the string resources use the same artifact), so
    `:ui` needs no `expect`/`actual` for one call. It has no `inSampleSize`, so the decoder
    refuses a source over 4 MB and the row draws its mime icon instead; decoded squares sit in a
    byte-bounded LRU.
  - **Android hands a blob out through a `FileProvider`, and only the blob directory.** A file
    under `filesDir` is unreadable to every other app and a `file://` uri throws since Android 7.
    `res/xml/attachment_paths.xml` declares `attachments/` alone — not `files/`, which holds the
    database, and not the staging directory. The desktop uses `java.awt.Desktop`, guarded twice,
    since a headless run opens nothing and says so.
  - **A recurring task hands its attachments to the next occurrence**, with the checklist — the
    rows are cloned, the bytes are not, because two rows naming one hash *is* the dedupe.
- **A fresh install starts empty.** There is no seeding: the first screen a new user sees is the
  empty state, not sample content. Anything that needs a populated app (screenshots, a demo) is
  built by importing a backup file, not by putting fixtures back into the app.
- **Deleting a project never silently hides tasks.** `ProjectStore.tombstoneWithChildren` runs in
  one transaction and either moves the affected tasks to the Inbox (`projectId = NULL`, the
  default) or deletes them; without that, a task filed under a deleted project would keep a
  `projectId` no project answers to and disappear from every list. `CadenceRepository.deleteProject`
  reads which tasks are affected, deletes their attachments and runs that cascade all inside one
  `storeTransaction.run { … }` too — a process killed mid-delete used to be able to leave a task's
  attachments gone while the task itself (and its `projectId`) survived, or the reverse.
  `deleteTask` gets the same treatment for the same reason. The repository returns the ids of the
  tasks it deleted so the ViewModel can cancel their alarms — `ReminderScheduler.sync` only ever
  sees the tasks that still exist, so it cannot cancel one that is already gone.
- **The danger zone is the only wipe, and it is still a tombstone.** Settings → Danger zone →
  *Delete all data* runs `CadenceRepository.deleteEverything()`, which stamps `deletedAt` on every
  task and every project (`taskRow.tombstoneAll`, `projectRow.tombstoneAllRows`) rather than
  dropping rows — a `DELETE` would leave the other device with rows it has never seen deleted, and
  the next pull would hand the whole list back. Three gates, deliberately: the button, a dialog
  naming both counts, and the ordinary `UNDO_WINDOW` the write is deferred by, so the snackbar's
  **Undo** still catches it. Tasks are wiped before projects and the two are separate statements —
  a process killed between them leaves empty projects, never orphaned tasks — and both halves are
  idempotent, so running it again finishes the job.
- **The undo window is a deferred write, and the snackbar is one slot two things want — and both
  live in `ui/undo/UndoSlot.kt`, not in `CadenceViewModel`.** A delete hides its rows at once
  (`UndoSlot.hiddenIds`, read into `CadenceUiState.pendingDeleteIds`) and writes nothing for the
  window `UndoSlot` is constructed with (`CadenceViewModel.UNDO_WINDOW`); undo cancels the job, so
  it costs no transaction at all. `CadenceViewModel` only supplies the `commit` lambda —
  `commitPendingDelete`, the repository write and cancelling reminders, with the write itself
  ticking `repository.localWrites` (and so arming sync) on its own — and the
  three call sites (`deleteTask`, `deleteProject`, `wipeEverything`) that hand `UndoSlot.offer` a
  fresh `UndoAction`; the *when* is entirely `UndoSlot`'s. Two rules fall out of there being *one*
  pending action but possibly more than one set of held ids (#114), and both are pinned in
  `UndoSlotTest` against a recording `commit` lambda with no repository at all —
  `CadenceViewModelUndoTest` keeps only the tests that need the real store and scheduler:
  - **`undo()` subtracts its own action's ids, never the whole set.** A second delete settles the
    first one out of band — the user moved on — and that commit is in flight with its ids still
    in `hiddenIds`. Clearing the flow flashed those rows back into every list until the write
    landed and took them away again. Nothing rescues a settled delete; that is what settling it
    meant.
  - **An informational message never displaces a live undo — it queues** (`UndoSlot.show`,
    `queuedMessage`). The two are not equals: a validation message is repeatable feedback about a
    form still on screen, while the undo is a five-second, one-time chance to take a delete back.
    Overwriting it took that chance away silently, and the delete committed anyway.
- **Projects nest exactly one level**, which the editor enforces rather than the model:
  `CadenceUiState.nestingCandidates` returns nothing for a project that already has subprojects,
  and the "Nest under" section is then left out of the dialog.
- **Backup is a published contract, the DB is not.** `domain/backup/BackupCodec.kt` writes
  `{"format":"cadence.backup","version":1,…}` with ISO-8601 dates and recurrence as a nested
  object — deliberately *not* the packed `RecurrenceCodec` column — because a future web app
  reads these files. Unknown keys are ignored on read; a higher `version` is refused. Changing
  a field means bumping `VERSION` and keeping the old shape readable — but *adding* an optional
  field (`parentId`, `spawnedFromId`) deliberately leaves `VERSION` alone, since a bump would make
  older installs refuse the whole file over one key they can ignore. Links are repaired rather
  than trusted: a task pointing at a missing project lands in the Inbox, a recurrence link to an
  occurrence the file lacks is dropped, and a subtask whose parent the file
  lacks — or one in a chain or cycle — is set free by `normalisedParents`. It uses
  kotlinx.serialization (pure Kotlin, so the codec stays JVM-testable — `org.json` is stubbed
  in unit tests). Importing **merges** via `BackupStore.mergeAll` in one transaction — it used to
  replace both tables, which is why importing was a data-loss event. Ids come straight from the
  file and task→project links need no remapping; tasks referencing a project the file lacks fall
  back to the Inbox. No write empties the database as a side effect any more — the one operation
  that empties it is the Settings **danger zone**, which the user asks for outright. One rule
  decides every record: greater `updatedAt` wins, ties keep what is stored, and a tombstone
  competes on its timestamp like any other version rather than being special-cased — a v1 file,
  whose rows decode to `Instant.EPOCH`, therefore loses every conflict. **Importing has exactly
  one exception to that, and sync has none: a record that lands on a row this device has
  tombstoned is restored** (`BackupStore.mergeAll`'s `revivedAt`, stamped with the import's clock
  so the revival outlives the tombstone the server still holds). A file is a person asking for its
  contents, not a device offering a version, and a file written *before* the delete it is meant to
  undo is the ordinary case — `tools/todoist_import.py` derives ids from project names, so
  re-importing an export after deleting its staging project used to write nothing at all while
  still reporting the file's counts. A record that is itself a tombstone revives nothing.
- **Sync runs itself, and every step of a round is idempotent** (`data/sync/
  CadenceSyncEngine.kt`, ADR 0002). Signed out it does nothing at all and no request is made.
  Signed in, `syncOnce()` holds a `Mutex` and does: pull rows at or after the stored cursor →
  merge each page and advance the cursor **in the same transaction** → push everything written
  since the watermark, tombstones included → collect tombstones past 90 days — on the server
  through four Data API `DELETE`s first, then locally — at most daily and only after a round that
  pushed (client-driven since ADR 0005; there is no server cron). Five things are load-bearing:
  - **The cursor is the server's clock, the merge is the device's.** `server_updated_at` is
    written only by the server's trigger, so a device whose clock is wrong can lose a conflict
    but can never make itself invisible to the other device. The pull deliberately re-reads a
    five-second overlap, because Postgres's `now()` is transaction-start time and a transaction
    that began earlier may commit later, landing behind a cursor already advanced past it.
  - **There is no `dirty` column, and it is the server that makes that safe.** The push sends
    everything above the watermark, so a row that arrived *from* the server gets pushed straight
    back; the `BEFORE INSERT OR UPDATE` trigger in `neon/migrations/` sees a timestamp that
    is not strictly greater and returns `NULL`, which skips *that row* without failing the batch.
    Ties keep the incumbent, on both sides.
  - **The new watermark is the newest `updatedAt` actually sent**, never "now": a row written
    while the push was in flight stands above it and waits for the next round rather than being
    skipped by a clock that ran ahead of the data.
  - **The session lives in `syncStateRow`, not in the settings file** — a `NeonSession` (Data
    API JWT + Better Auth session token) the engine keeps fresh itself: the JWT is re-minted via
    `GET /token` preemptively near its `exp`, once more on a 401, under its own mutex so four
    parallel pulls produce one mint. It has to stay
    consistent with the cursors beside it. A stored value that does not decode — the supabase-kt
    session every pre-0005 install carries — counts as signed out, which is the upgrade path: one
    re-sign-in, cleared cursors, full push. Signing out clears session, cursors and watermark and
    deletes **nothing**: the local database is the source of truth.
  - **The wire is the published shape, not the storage shape.** `data/sync/RemoteRecords.kt`
    speaks ISO dates and a `jsonb` recurrence object, and its DTOs are separate types from
    `BackupCodec`'s on purpose, so a Postgres column rename cannot change the shape of an
    exported backup file. Timestamps truncate to milliseconds in both directions, or a row
    pushed and pulled back returns strictly newer than its local copy and ping-pongs forever.
- **Nobody presses anything to sync** (ADR 0002, decisions 11, 13 and 14). Rounds start on app
  start and every return to the foreground, two seconds after a write, fire-and-forget on stop
  and window close, and — on the desktop only — every 15 minutes. There is no periodic
  `WorkManager` job and no Android poll: the phone is stale only while nobody is looking at it
  — with one carve-out: a home-screen widget counts as somebody looking, so while a task widget
  exists and a session is stored, `SyncWorker` also runs a 15-minute periodic pull beside its
  one-shot post-write push (ADR 0002, amendment 1; see the widget notes). Three things to know
  before adding a trigger or a list:
  - **The debounce is armed by `CadenceRepository.localWrites`, not by the task flow.** The
    ViewModel used to call `armSync()` from each mutation itself; the repository announces "this
    device wrote" now, through a private `write { }` wrapper every mutating method routes through,
    and `startWriteDebounce` collects that flow instead. The reason hasn't moved: a row merged
    *in* from a pull lands in `repository.tasks` exactly like a local edit does, and a debounce
    watching that flow would have two devices pushing each other awake forever — but a pull can
    no longer tick `localWrites` even by accident, because `SqlDelightSyncStore.mergeAndAdvance`
    writes straight to the database and never calls through `CadenceRepository` at all. Settings
    still never arm it — they are per-device, and `SettingsStore` doesn't touch the repository. A
    new mutation method therefore has to route its write through `write { }` itself, matching
    "arm on `Success` only" for one that returns a `RepositoryResult` — the rule is tested now
    (`CadenceRepositoryTest`'s `localWrites` section), not just a convention every call site had
    to remember.
  - **The lifecycle triggers hang off the shell, not the ViewModel**, and go through
    `CadenceSyncEngine.syncInBackground()`, which runs on the *application* scope:
    `:app-android`'s `CadenceApplication` observes `ProcessLifecycleOwner` (the Activity's
    lifecycle would sync on every rotation), `:app-desktop`'s `main()` syncs at startup and on
    `onCloseRequest`, and both rely on `CadenceSyncEngine.startForegroundPoll()` for everything
    in between.
  - **The header shows where sync stands, and shows nothing at all signed out.**
    `ui/components/SyncControls.kt` holds the indicator, the pull-to-refresh wrapper and the
    failure snackbar; a shell hands the four top-level screens one `SyncControls` and the two
    flags in it are the whole platform difference (Android pulls, the desktop gets a button and
    `Ctrl`/`Cmd`+`R`). Every failed round raises a snackbar, `OFFLINE` included, and a new
    failure replaces the one on screen — which is why the engine publishes `failures` as a
    `SharedFlow` beside `status`: identical consecutive failures would collapse in a `StateFlow`.
  - **The foreground poll stands where realtime stood** (ADR 0005; realtime was ADR 0002,
    decision 12 — Neon has no change feed). `CadenceSyncEngine.startForegroundPoll()` runs a full
    `syncOnce()` every 60 seconds; signed out a tick costs nothing, because the round returns
    before making a request. Its lifetime is the shells' one real difference, exactly as the
    socket's was: `:app-android` starts it in `onStart` and stops it in `onStop` (a background
    poll is the battery drain `WorkManager` was rejected to avoid), `:app-desktop` starts it once
    and holds it for the process, minimised included — a desktop that stopped polling on alt-tab
    would go stale exactly when the phone is in use. `CadenceViewModel` used to carry its own
    older 15-minute `syncPollInterval` poll beside this one, redundant once the foreground poll
    existed; it has been removed rather than kept "harmless" — one timer is one thing to reason
    about sync's cadence from.
- **Reminders are a per-device setting** (`CadenceSettings.remindersEnabled`), on by default on
  Android and off on the desktop — the default lives in each shell's `SettingsStore`, since that
  is the only thing that differs. Once a task exists on both devices both would otherwise fire
  for it at the same minute. The flag travels through the port as it is —
  `ReminderScheduler.sync(tasks, leadMinutes, enabled)` — and `ReminderReconciler` treats `false`
  as an *empty plan*, so every alarm the device had armed is cancelled. It used to be encoded by
  stripping `dueTime`/`reminderTime` off every task before the call, which the port could not
  tell from "no reminder set"; nothing strips anything now. The reconciler diffs against the
  *whole* armed set on both shells (Android reads every `active_leads:` entry, not one task's),
  so a task that vanished without a `cancel` call — one a pull tombstoned — loses its alarms on
  the next emission too. The boot receiver passes the same flag, so a phone with reminders off
  no longer re-arms them on reboot.
- Settings persist to `SharedPreferences` via `SharedPrefsSettingsStore` (not DataStore), the
  Android implementation of `:ui`'s `SettingsStore` port, exposed as a `StateFlow`. They stay
  per-device and out of sync — theme, density, language and reminders describe a screen or a
  machine, not a task list.
- **`SettingsStore`'s setters are not `suspend`, so the desktop's writes go behind them** (#104).
  `SharedPreferences` needs no such thing and `CadenceViewModel.setTheme` calls straight through,
  which put a synchronous file write on the Compose UI thread every time someone flipped a
  switch. `DesktopSettingsStore` now updates the flow on the spot and writes on the container's
  application scope; the file goes through a temp file and a rename, because a crash inside the
  old in-place `writeText` left a truncated `settings.json` that `load()` read as "no settings at
  all". Two rules come with that:
  - **A write puts down the state it finds, never the value that started it.** Coroutines
    launched in order do not reach a lock in order, so an older write would otherwise rename a
    stale file over a newer one.
  - **`AppContainer.shutdown()` calls `flush()` before `exitApplication()`.** The writes run on
    daemon threads and would be taken with the process — the toggle someone flipped a second
    before quitting is exactly the one to keep. `onCloseRequest` and the tray menu's Quit are the
    two ways out of the desktop app, and both call this one method rather than repeating the
    order by hand: a last fire-and-forget `syncInBackground()` while there is still a process to
    run it (ADR 0002, decision 11), then `settingsStore.flush()`, then `CadenceCore.close()` to
    cancel the application scope and close the database driver — `viewModel.close()` stays
    outside it, since the ViewModel's scope belongs to `main()`, not the container. Anything
    reading the file straight back (every test that does) has to call `flush()` too. `load()`
    stays on the calling thread, alone: it runs once before any window exists, and loading
    asynchronously would paint the defaults and swap them.

### UI conventions

- Two CompositionLocals carry what the M3 scheme cannot: `LocalCadenceColors` (priority colours,
  overdue accents) and `LocalCadenceDensity` (64dp comfortable vs 52dp compact rows, including
  whether the meta line renders). Read density from the local — do not hardcode row heights.
- **Priority is never colour alone.** `PrioritySpine` is always paired with its `P1`…`P4` label
  and announces itself as e.g. "P2 · High". Touch targets stay ≥44–48dp even where the design
  draws a 24dp circle. Type scale carries 1.3× line-height headroom for 200% font scaling.
- All icons go through `ui/components/AppIcons.kt` — don't import `Icons.Rounded.*` in screens.
- Labels in fixed-width slots (the bottom bar) use `FittedLabel`, which measures the slot and
  shrinks the type rather than wrapping — "Demnächst" is twice the width of "Today".

### Localisation

English and German. Since ADR 0001 phase 3 the strings live in **`:ui`'s
`src/commonMain/composeResources/values{,-de}/strings.xml`** and are reached as `Res.string.x` /
`Res.plurals.x` (`org.jetbrains.compose.resources`, not `androidx.compose.ui.res`) — the XML
shape, `<plurals>` included, is unchanged. `:app-android` keeps four strings of its own in `res/values/`:
the launcher label and the three the notification channel needs, none of which a composable ever
sees. `res/xml/locales_config.xml` still drives the Android 13+ per-app language picker.

The generated accessors are one top-level property per string, so files import them with
`de.andi1984.cadence.ui.resources.*` rather than 245 import lines.

**No user-visible string belongs in Kotlin.** Consequences worth knowing before adding a screen:

- The `domain/` layer produces no prose. `RecurrenceEngine.summarize()` returns a structured
  `RecurrenceSummary`/`MonthlyPhrase` (unit-testable on the JVM), and `ui/format/` turns it into
  words. `Priority` keeps only `shortLabel` ("P2"); its name and explanation live in
  `ui/format/PriorityLabels.kt`.
- Everything in `ui/format/` is `@Composable`, because the wording *and* the date patterns
  (`date_pattern_*`) come from resources. Use `currentLocale()` from `DateLabels.kt` rather than
  `Locale.getDefault()` — the app language can differ from the system one. It reads
  `LocalAppLocale`, which `CadenceTheme` provides from a `locale` parameter: the *shell* is what
  knows where the language comes from — Android's per-app picker. `:app-desktop` passes
  `Locale.getDefault()` for now; the explicit desktop language setting ADR 0001 decision 9
  describes (`CadenceSettings` has no language field yet) is left for a follow-up rather than
  bundled into "first runnable build".
- Android used to hand two of these labels over ready-made — `Formatter.formatShortFileSize` and
  `DateUtils.getRelativeTimeSpanString`. Neither has a desktop counterpart, so both are now
  `ui/format/DiagnosticLabels.kt`, resources and all.
- Never branch on a formatted string (an early bug compared a day header to `"Tomorrow"`);
  compare the underlying date or enum.
- Counts go through `<plurals>`, even where English and German happen to agree.
- The quick-add parser (`domain/parse/`) keeps its keywords in `QuickAddLexicon`, not in the
  grammar: `QuickAddParser.parse` takes one and `QuickAddSheet` picks it with
  `QuickAddLexicon.forLocale(currentLocale())`. Spelled-out counts are vocabulary too
  (`numbers`: `three`, `third`, `drei`, `dritten` all read as 3), so anywhere the grammar takes
  a digit it takes a word. Lexicons compose and English is always folded in,
  so `every 2 weeks` and `alle 2 Wochen` both parse in a German install. Weekday and month names
  are never listed — they come from `java.time` for the locale, so an unlisted language still
  reads `vendredi`. Adding a language means adding a lexicon, not touching the parser.
- Patterns are compiled by **ICU on device but by `java.util.regex` in the unit tests**, and the
  two disagree. ICU rejects the `(?u)`/`(?U)` inline flags (a crash the JVM tests cannot see), and
  `IGNORE_CASE` alone folds only ASCII on the JVM. `QuickAddPatterns` therefore spells word
  boundaries as `\p{L}` lookarounds and writes non-ASCII letters as two-case classes. Don't put
  `\b` or an inline flag back in.

## CI / releases

The whole workflow — `build.sh`, the four workflows and their inputs, version derivation,
signing — is the `releasing` skill (`.claude/skills/releasing/SKILL.md`). Three rules hold
everywhere:

- **Only `ci.yml` and `pages.yml` run on their own.** `android.yml`, `desktop.yml` and
  `release.yml` are `workflow_dispatch` only; don't give them an automatic trigger without
  being asked for it outright — a macOS leg on every PR is the bill this rule prevents.
- **Verify locally before pushing.** The suite is about five seconds of test time; CI only
  confirms what a laptop already knows.
- **The debug key `app-android/debug.keystore` is committed and must stay that way**, and the
  release key never enters a checkout — it arrives through the `CADENCE_KEYSTORE_*` secrets.
