     *
     * The *process* lifecycle, not the Activity's: a rotation stops and starts the Activity, and
     * a device that syncs every time the phone is turned sideways is doing work nobody asked for.
     * `ProcessLifecycleOwner` waits out that gap and reports only the ones that mean "the app
     * came to the front" and "the app left it".
     *
     * Both rounds are fire-and-forget on the container's application scope. `onStop` carries no
     * completion guarantee on Android anyway, and a push that misses its window ships on the next
     * start — the local database is the source of truth until then. There is deliberately no
     * periodic `WorkManager` job and no background poll behind this: the phone is stale only
     * while nobody is looking at it. (A write made from a *widget* has no next start to ride on,
     * so that one goes through `sync/SyncWorker`, a one-shot — the only WorkManager use here.)
     *
     * The change socket follows the same two events, and only these (ADR 0002, decision 12): a
     * websocket held open in the background is the wakelock `WorkManager` was rejected to avoid,
     * and nothing on this device is reading a row while the app is not in front of the user.
