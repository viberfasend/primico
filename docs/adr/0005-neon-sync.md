**Status:** accepted
**Date:** 2026-08-25
**Supersedes:** ADR 0002 decisions 6 (supabase-kt as the client) and 12 (realtime as the
accelerant); moves decision 2's account into Neon Auth; makes the server half of the tombstone
sweep client-driven. Everything else in ADR 0002 — the hub-and-spoke shape, the cursors, the
watermark, the stale-write trigger, tombstones, RLS, the sync triggers of decision 11 — is
unchanged and still governs.

## Context

ADR 0002 chose "a Postgres we don't operate", and Supabase was the Postgres. The project moved to
[Neon](https://neon.tech) — same idea, different operator: a fresh Neon project with Neon Auth
enabled, and the Supabase project retired. Neon is plain Postgres plus two managed pieces this
app uses — the **Data API** (a PostgREST endpoint per branch) and **Neon Auth** (a managed
Better Auth server under Neon's console) — and *without* two pieces the Supabase design leaned on: there is no realtime
change feed, and pg_cron on a compute that scales to zero only fires while something else keeps
the compute awake.

There was no data migration, deliberately: the local SQLite on each device is the source of truth
(ADR 0001), so the server starts empty and the first signed-in device pushes its whole database
up — the ordinary full-push path that null cursors and an EPOCH watermark already are.

## Decisions

1. **The wire is the Neon Data API, spoken directly.** PostgREST conventions over plain Ktor
   HTTP (`PostgrestHttp`): `gte.`-filtered ordered selects for the pull, `POST` with
   `Prefer: resolution=merge-duplicates` and `on_conflict=user_id,id` for the push, `DELETE`
   with a filter for the sweep. No SDK — supabase-kt is gone, and nothing replaced it, because
   three requests do not need a library. The DTOs (`RemoteRecords.kt`) are unchanged; the wire
   shape survived the operator.

2. **Auth is Neon Auth (Better Auth), hand-rolled.** No Kotlin SDK exists, so `NeonAuthClient`
   makes the three REST calls the app needs: `POST /sign-in/email` (→ the long-lived session),
   `GET /token` (→ the short-lived Data API JWT), `POST /sign-out`. The account is still
   created in the console, never in the app (ADR 0002, decision 2). No API key travels with any
   of it — the auth URL names the project, the credential is the account, RLS protects the rows.

   **The session is a cookie, verified against the live endpoint**: Neon's deployment does not
   enable Better Auth's bearer plugin, so the raw token in the sign-in *body* opens nothing —
   only the signed `token.signature` pair from the `Set-Cookie` header does. The client captures
   that cookie pair verbatim and replays it in a `Cookie` header on `/token` and `/sign-out`;
   no cookie storage is installed on the HTTP client, because the cookie lives in
   `syncStateRow.session` beside the cursors.

3. **The session is ours now, refresh machine included.** `NeonSession` (Data API JWT + Better
   Auth session cookie + email) is serialised into `syncStateRow.session`, where the supabase-kt
   `UserSession` used to live — same column, same "beside the cursors it must stay consistent
   with" reasoning. ADR 0002 decision 6 kept supabase-kt precisely because silent token refresh
   is where a hand-rolled client goes subtly wrong; that risk is accepted now and contained in
   one small class (`SessionTokens`): re-mint the JWT via `GET /token` preemptively near its
   `exp`, once more on a 401, under a mutex so parallel pulls produce one mint, persist before
   use, and read a refused mint as SESSION_EXPIRED while keeping the session stored so Settings
   can still say whose it was.

   **Upgrade consequence:** an install that was signed in against Supabase finds a stored session
   that no longer decodes, and is therefore signed out — one re-sign-in, from cleared state, and
   the full push/pull that follows is the data migration.

4. **Polling replaces realtime.** Neon has no change feed, and ADR 0002 decision 12 already
   named realtime an accelerant the round must never depend on — every reconnect ran a full
   `syncOnce()`. The replacement is `startForegroundPoll()`: a 60-second `syncOnce()` loop with
   exactly the socket's old lifetime (Android foreground-only; desktop for the process). The
   change a websocket delivered in a second now arrives within a minute while both apps are
   open. Accepted: more requests while foregrounded, a minute of staleness instead of a second.
   The desktop's older 15-minute `syncPollInterval` poll stays, redundant but harmless.

5. **The tombstone sweep is client-driven.** The nightly pg_cron job and `collect_tombstones()`
   were not ported: cron on scale-to-zero compute is a job that mostly does not run. Instead the
   engine, after a successful push and at most daily (the local sweep's own cadence, same
   `lastSweepAt`), issues `DELETE /{table}?deleted_at=not.is.null&server_updated_at=lt.{now-90d}`
   for all four tables, then collects locally. Server first, local second: a failed server sweep
   fails the round and is retried, so the local copy is never collected before the server's.
   The filter is by `server_updated_at` for the retired job's own reason — `deleted_at` is a
   device's clock. The owner `FOR ALL` RLS policy is what authorises it; the 90-day floor the
   old function enforced is now the client's discipline alone, which one device talking to its
   own rows can carry.

6. **No foreign key to the users table.** `user_id uuid default (auth.user_id())::uuid`, cast
   because pg_session_jwt hands back the JWT `sub` as text (verified live: `auth.user_id()`
   returns `text`, the `sub` is the account's uuid, and the JWT carries `role: authenticated`
   with a 15-minute lifetime). The old `references auth.users on
   delete cascade` has no counterpart: Neon Auth mirrors users into `neon_auth.users_sync`,
   whose id is text and which lags the auth service — a constraint on row arrival order, which
   this schema has never tolerated anywhere else.

7. **Migrations are a bash script and a bookkeeping table.** `neon/migrate.sh` applies
   `neon/migrations/*.sql` in filename order, each exactly once, recorded by *filename* in
   `public.schema_migrations` — the Supabase CLI's server-clock version stamps were the mismatch
   that made `db push` refuse, and that failure mode is designed out. The files stay idempotent
   for the SQL-editor paste path. `neon/tests/run.sh` is the ported docker harness. The Data API
   must be enabled before migrating (it provisions `auth.user_id()` and the roles); the baseline
   refuses with a sentence when it was not.

8. **PROJECT_ASLEEP is retired.** Supabase's paused-project 540 has no Neon counterpart; a Neon
   cold start is the first request taking seconds, which generous HTTP timeouts absorb as
   latency. `SyncFailure` is back to OFFLINE / SESSION_EXPIRED / SERVER.

## Consequences

- One class still holds the whole backend coupling (`CadenceSyncEngine` and its two small
  helpers); the engine's public surface changed by exactly one pair of names
  (`startRealtime`/`stopRealtime` → `startForegroundPoll`/`stopForegroundPoll`), so the
  ViewModel, both shells, the widgets and `SyncWorker` are otherwise untouched.
- The engine is now constructible and testable on any JVM — supabase-kt's Android-runtime need
  was why the ViewModel tests sat in `jvmTest`; they may move to `jvmSharedTest` some day, but
  nothing forces it.
- `core`'s only wire dependency is Ktor + kotlinx.serialization; the Ktor version is no longer
  pinned to what supabase-kt resolves.
- Environment/config surface: `CADENCE_NEON_DATA_API_URL` and `CADENCE_NEON_AUTH_URL`
  (committed defaults in `NeonConfig` — until amendment 3; no API key exists in this design),
  plus `CADENCE_NEON_DB_URL` for `migrate.sh` only.
- The `supabase/` tree, the supabase CLI devDependency (and with it `package.json`), and the
  realtime/pg_cron migrations are deleted. ADR 0002 remains the protocol's record.

## Amendment 1 — the bookkeeping table was in the Data API (2026-08-25)

Found by Neon's advisor hours after the cutover, and worth writing down because the mechanism
surprises: **enabling the Data API leaves a default-privilege entry** granting `authenticated`
every table the owner creates in `public` afterwards. Decision 7's `schema_migrations` is
created by `migrate.sh`, not by a migration, so it inherited that and was readable — and
insertable — over HTTP by any signed-in account. No task data was exposed (the four app tables
carry RLS with an owner policy, which is exactly what that is for), but a forged row in the
migration history would have made the next `migrate.sh` skip a migration.

`0002_lock_bookkeeping.sql` does three overlapping things: revokes the grants, enables RLS with
no policy at all so a returned grant still denies, and revokes the default privilege itself so
the next table is not handed away either. `migrate.sh` now creates the table locked in the same
breath, so a fresh project is never exposed even briefly. The harness stubs Neon's default
privileges from now on — its *absence* is why the tests passed while the live project did not.

The rule this leaves: **a table is not private because nothing granted it.** State the grants.

## Amendment 2 — `neon/db.sh`, maintenance from a laptop (2026-08-25)

Decision 5 put the tombstone sweep in the client, which covers the ordinary case and cannot
cover anything outside one signed-in account: rows belonging to an account that no longer signs
in are unreachable from every device. `neon/db.sh` is the missing half — `status`, `sweep`
(dry-run unless `--yes`, 90-day floor unless `--force`), `vacuum` — over the direct connection,
which on Neon carries BYPASSRLS. That is what lets it reach every account's rows, and why it
defaults to showing rather than doing, and why its predicate can only ever match rows that are
already tombstones.

## Amendment 3 — no default project; the endpoints are a build input (2026-09-14)

The repository went public. `NeonConfig`'s committed defaults named the maintainer's own project,
which every build from source would then have pointed at — a stranger's binary signing in
against one person's Neon Auth, and a public repository inviting password guessing at its
endpoint. The defaults are gone: `:core`'s `generateNeonConfig` task compiles
`CADENCE_NEON_DATA_API_URL` and `CADENCE_NEON_AUTH_URL` from the *build* environment into a
generated `NeonBuildConfig`, and `NeonConfig.fromBuild` is `null` when either is missing. (The
old run-time `System.getenv` read never reached Android at all — a phone has no shell
environment — so "point a build elsewhere without editing Kotlin" was only ever true of the
desktop.)

A null config adds one state, `SyncStatus.Unconfigured`, that the engine never leaves: Settings
explains and shows no form, every other surface treats it as signed out through
`SyncStatus.hasAccount`, and no request is made. The official builds receive the two values as
repository secrets beside the release-signing ones; anyone else builds against their own project
following `docs/self-hosting.md`, which is where the console walkthrough, the migrations, the
accounts and the maintenance CLI are now described for someone who is not the maintainer.
