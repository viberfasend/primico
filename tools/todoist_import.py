"""Turn a Todoist CSV export into a Primico backup file.

Todoist exports one CSV per project ("Garten [6g62GH268rQjFQ92].csv"). This script reads any
number of those files — or a whole export directory — and writes a single
`{"format":"cadence.backup","version":2,...}` document, the published contract
`core/.../domain/backup/BackupCodec.kt` reads. Import it in the app under Settings -> Data -> Import backup;
importing merges, so nothing already on the device is lost.

**Everything lands in one staging project, "Import <today>".** An import is a pile to sort, not
a merge: nothing appears in the Inbox or beside the projects already on the device until the
user moves it there deliberately. `--import-project NAME` renames the pile and
`--no-import-project` skips it.

How a Todoist row lands in Primico:

    file "Name [id].csv"  -> a subproject of the staging project, the "Inbox" file included
    section row           -> a section of that project — a heading inside its task list, which is
                             what Primico's own sections are; the tasks under it stay the
                             project's rather than moving into a project of their own
    task row, INDENT 1    -> a task in the current project, carrying the current section
    task row, INDENT >= 2 -> a subtask of the last INDENT 1 task (deeper levels flatten onto it,
                             because Primico nests subtasks exactly one level)
    note row              -> appended to the task above it, prefixed with the note's date
    DESCRIPTION           -> the task's notes
    PRIORITY 1..4         -> Primico P1..P4 (same numbering; --invert-priority if yours differs)
    DATE                  -> a due date, or a recurrence rule when it is a Todoist repeat phrase
                             ("jeden Monat", "every 2 weeks", "every! 3 months", ...)
    DEADLINE              -> the due date when DATE left none, otherwise a "Deadline: ..." note
    DURATION              -> a note line; Primico has no duration field

Ids are deterministic (UUIDv5 over the source file and row), so re-running this after adding a
task in Todoist and re-importing updates the rows it already wrote instead of duplicating them.

Usage:
    python3 tools/todoist_import.py ~/Downloads/"Todoist backup 2026-08-12 2248 UTC"
    python3 tools/todoist_import.py export/ --todoist-token 0123…    # exact dates from Todoist
    python3 tools/todoist_import.py export/*.csv -o primico-backup.json
    python3 tools/todoist_import.py export/ --split        # one JSON per project, into a folder
    python3 tools/todoist_import.py export/ --dry-run      # parse and report, write nothing
    python3 tools/todoist_import.py --self-test            # the parser's unit tests

**The export does not contain every due date.** A recurring task exports as its *rule* — `DATE`
reads "jährlich", not "23 Dec 2026" — so the next occurrence Todoist shows you is nowhere in the
file, and the rule alone can only put the task on today. Pass `--todoist-token` (or set
`TODOIST_API_TOKEN`) and the exact date and time of every task are read from the API and used
instead; the token comes from Todoist -> Settings -> Integrations -> Developer. Those dates are
matched by project, section and title — titles repeat across sections, and matching on the
project alone gave every copy of one whichever date Todoist listed last.

`--split` writes `cadence-<project>.json` per Todoist project rather than one file for the
whole export, so the import can be done a project at a time — the app's importer takes several
files in one go, and every split file carries the same staging project, so importing them in
any order or any grouping lands them all in the same pile.

    A recurring row exports as its *rule* — `DATE` reads "jährlich", never "23 Dec 2026" — so a
    yearly task's actual next occurrence exists only inside Todoist. Reading it back needs the
    API, which is what `--todoist-token` is for; without one the rule alone decides the date and
    a yearly task lands on today.

    The match is on the title, and **the section is part of the key**: "Gießen" under "Beet" and
    "Gießen" under "Gewächshaus" are two tasks with two dates, and a project-wide index kept only
    whichever the API listed last — every copy then imported carrying that one date. Each key
    holds every task that answers to it, so a title repeated inside one section is handed its
    dates in Todoist's own order rather than collapsing the same way.
