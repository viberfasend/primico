 * - **Completed tasks** are dropped from [TaskView.Inbox] and [TaskView.Project] unless

 *   an overdue task is open by definition ([Task.isOverdue]) — [TaskView.Upcoming] never shows
 *   a done task, and [TaskView.Search] never hides one, because search is meant to reach
 *   history.
 * - **The sort** is `settings.sortMode` everywhere ([sortedFor]), applied inside a band: the
 *   bands themselves are ordered by what they mean, not by importance.
 * - **Subtasks** are spliced in under whichever parent is in [expandedIds]
 *   ([CadenceUiState.expandedRows]). The container views start from
 *   [CadenceUiState.rootTasks]; the date-driven ones do not, because a dated subtask is work
 *   for that day in its own right.
 *
 * @param today the day the list is drawn for — passed in rather than read from the clock, so a
 *   test can name it.
 * @param expandedIds parents whose steps are shown inline. Screen-remembered state; views that
 *   never expand a row simply pass nothing.
